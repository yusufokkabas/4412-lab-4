1) Write a function Y=equalize(X) that equalizes the histogram of a given image X. Apply
your equalize function to different images. Compare the histograms of equalized and
original images. Export your code to this document as well as the histogram plot of
equalized image. Compare your function with the built-in histogram equalization function.
To demonstarte the performance of your function, try to select different types of images,
such as low contrast dark, white or gray images.
2) Write a function Y=match(X,Z) that matches the histogram of a given image X to the
histogram of a reference image Z. You can use your own equalize() function in your
implementation. You can use images you had found in the first part.
3) Try to embed these two functions (equalize and match) in a GUI so that the user can select
an image by means of a menu, perform histogram equalization or perform histogram
matching and lastly save the image in a desired format under a specified or user selected
directory.
